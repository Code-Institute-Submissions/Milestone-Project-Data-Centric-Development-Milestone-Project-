<h1>Practical Python and Data-Centric Development Milestone Project
</h1>

<h2>Project Summary</h2>
<p>Recipify - Recipe sharing app. The purpose is to build a full-stack site that allows users to manage a common dataset about a particular domain that allows users to create, locate, read, update and delete (CRUD) recipes. Recipify gives access to all the recipes in the database to all users. All users can add new recipes as well as edit, locate, and delete other recipes.
</p>
<p>
The project can be viewed <a href="https://recipify-food-app.herokuapp.com/">here</a>
</p>

<h2>Wireframes</h2>
<p>I've used AdobeXD to create my wireframe / mock-up. All my wireframes can be found in the following link
Initial Wireframes for the site: <a href="https://github.com/TobinWebDesign/Milestone-Project-Data-Centric-Development-Milestone-Project-/tree/master/wireframes">Wireframes</a>| 

</p>
<h1>UX</h1>

<p>My main goal in UX was to build a responsive website that is simple to use. The users can create their own recipes, view all the recipes created on the database, edit and delete all recipes. The target audience for this app is anyone who has passion for cooking, wants to discover new recipes or needs to store their own recipes online.
Creating a modern and user-friendly interface with easy access to all information is the key to giving users a feeling of reliability and positiveness. I developed this app in a way that everyone can view and edit all the recipes on the website. The next phase of the project would be to only authors make changes to their recipes.
The structure of the website is well-organised and easy navigation.

<h1>Testing</h1>

Testing was performed in 3 different ways.
- Browser Testing
- User testing
- Manual Testing

<h3>Browser Testing</h3>
While my main choice of browser for development is google chrome, I regularly checked the performance on the Microsoft Edge and Safari browsers. Making use of browser resizing and dev tools device toolbars on each browser to test responsiveness and how the grid, fonts and media queries were performing and the consistency between each. Adjusting to find a happy medium for all three.
After I had test deployed the site to heroku I was able to see the real life versions which I was able to test on android and iphone phone.
Known Issue
<li>Mobile nav animation</li>

<h3>User testing
</h3>
â€¦.

<li>...</li>

<h3>Manual Testing
</h3>
View | Add | Edit | Delete | Search
<h4>All recipes and single recipe display
</h4>
<li>...</li>
<h4>Add New Recipe
</h4>
<li>I added plenty of test recipes to check the functionality throughout the development. If I leave some of the required fields empty, I will not be able to submit the form. </li>
</li>
<h4>Edit Recipe
</h4>
<li>Edit recipe button is visible on the recipe page. Once clicked it opens a page with a form that allows the user to edit the recipe. </li>
<h4>Delete Recipe
</h4>
<li>Delete button is visible  on the recipe page.  Once clicked it deletes the recipe from the database</li>
<h4>Search Recipe
</h4>
<li>The search box is visible on all pages and allows users search keywords in the recipe title. </li>

<h2>Issues discovered while testing and how they were rectified.</h2>
<li>This site was tested across multiple browsers (Chrome, Microsorft Edge, FireFox) and on multiple mobile devices (iPhone 4, 5, 7, 8, X, iPad, iPad Pro, Galaxy S5, Pixel 2, and Pixel 2XL) to ensure compatibility and responsiveness.  </li>
<li>For testing the responsive aspect of the website I used a Google Chrome Developer Tools</li>
<li>Side nav - the mobile side nav was not functioning correctly. This was rectifies by using URL_for as the source</li>
<li>Search box - there was a bug where I had incorrect defination resulting in the search_recipes page not displaying. I also had issues with searching for keyword in the recipe name. This was rectified with help from the toutors and my mentor. </li>
<h3>Known Issues</h3>
<li>presently not all keywords in the recipe_name are searchable</li>

<h1>Depolyment</h1>
<h3>Deployment to Heroku
</h3>
In order to deploy my project to Heroku I have completed the following steps, you can view it <a href="https://recipify-food-app.herokuapp.com/">here</a>.
<li>Created a Procfile with the command echo web: python run.py > Procfile.</li>
<li>Created a requirement.txt file so Heroku know what python modules it will need to run my application with the command pip freeze > requirements.txt
</li>
<li>Created a new branch to test deployment to heroku changing MONGO_URI from local to mongo atlas, changed app.run() to set debug to False.
</li>
<li>Created a new project on heroku and in the deploy section linked my github repository with heroku in order to deploy straight from the source.
 </li>
<li>Configured any environment variables in Heroku App Settings > Config Vars such as my Secret Key, IP PORT and MONGO_URI.
</li>
<li>Finalised all code, and made sure that it was production ready and ensured that my .gitignore was not uploading any secret keys.</li>
<li>Deployed the application from heroku admin page using linked repository and master branch.
</li>
<li>The application is now fully deployed to Heroku
</li>
