<h2>Testing links betweens pages</h2>
For this section I tested all of the links between the pages, navigation bar and and links built into the page. Testing all of the links resulted in everything linking to another page in the website working as intended by staying within the tab.
All links to which the user is directed to another site opened in a separate browser tab. These links include social site and the third-party ticket purchasing site.
 
<h2>Issues discovered while testing and how they were rectified.</h2>
<li>This site was tested across multiple browsers (Chrome, Microsorft Edge, FireFox) and on multiple mobile devices (iPhone 4, 5, 7, 8, X, iPad, iPad Pro, Galaxy S5, Pixel 2, and Pixel 2XL) to ensure compatibility and responsiveness.  </li>
<li>For testing the responsive aspect of the website I used a Google Chrome Developer Tools</li>
<li>During the testing phase there were issues with the responsiveness of the side bar and how it migrated to a header bar in mobile.</li>
<li>Another responsive dificulty was found in positioning the right pannel results table. Moving from absolute positioning in desktop to reletive positioning in mobile</li>
<li>The Google Maps API had a lag when the page was loading. This was overcome by adding $( document ).ready() which only runs once the page DOM is ready for JavaScript code to execute</li>
<li>Wen the website first loaded there were no markers until a town name was added to the search box. This was an issue as is made for a poor user experience. The was overcome using the getBounds() function. </li>
<li>Validating the code was done with the help of <a href="https://validator.w3.org/nu/#textarea">Nu Html Checker</a> and validating of the CSS was done with the help of <a href="https://jigsaw.w3.org/css-validator/">W3C CSS Validation Service, Jigsaw</a></li>
<li>I validated my maps.js and sendemail.js with <a href="https://jshint.com/">JSHint</a></li>

This website is currently viewable with no deployment issues in:
<li>Google Chrome</li>
<li>Microsorft Edge</li>

<h2>Acknowledgements</h2>

<P>My mentor Anthony Ngene also helped me out with UX improvements, duplicate code issues, loading lag on Maps API. Most importantly Anthony guided me through how to make the markers load when the page loaded.  Design inspiration came from Airbnb, Booking.com and other tourism websites. </P>
